# Numerical Optimization in Robotics

This repository contains the code for the course "Numerical Optimization in Robotics" at Shenlanxueyuan. All the code is written in C++ and Python, and has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04.

## Compile and Run built-in examples

```bash
./scripts/configure.sh -t all
```

The above command will compile the code and run the examples written in coressponding source files. You can also run the examples by yourself, following the instructions below for each homework.

## Homework 1: Linear-search Steepest Gradient Descent

The executable file is `build/lsgd/lsgd`. To run the program, you have to provide the following arguments:
1. log file path.
2. problem dimension.

For example, to run the program with a 10-dimensional problem, you can run the following command:
```bash
./build/lsgd/lsgd ./build/lsgd/log.txt 10
```

The test case of dimension 2 is provided in `scripts/test.sh`. It will be called in `scripts/configure.sh`, write results in `data/lsgd/yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss.log`, and plot the result in `data/lsgd/yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss.png`.

## Homework 2: Smooth Navigation Path Generation

In this problem, two executable files are provided: `build/bfgs/bfgs` and `build/bfgs/path_smoother_node`. The former is used to run the BFGS algorithm to find the optimal point for Rosenbrock function, which acts as a test case for our implementation of BFGS algorithm. You can refer to the instructions of Homework 1 to run the program.

The latter is used to run the path smoother node. It provides a GUI to visualize the obstacle map and the path generated by the path smoother. After you click two points (initial and goal) on the map, the path will be generated and displayed on the map. You can also change the initial and goal points by clicking on the map. The demo video is provided in `misc/path_smoother.gif`.
